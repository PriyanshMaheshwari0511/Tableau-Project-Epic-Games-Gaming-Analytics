As an Analyst working for the International Olympics Committee, you are tasked with analyzing the extensive dataset covering the Summer and Winter Olympics held between 1896 and 2016. Your goal is to provide comprehensive insights into the performance of athletes, medals, and sports during this significant period.

#### 1.  Athlete Performance Analysis:
 Analyze the dataset to identify the top-performing athletes, sports, and countries in terms of medal counts, participation, and performance trends over the years.

#### 2.  Medal Distribution Analysis:
Examine the medal distribution patterns across different sports, countries, and Olympic Games to identify any correlations, trends, or anomalies.

 #### 3. Country-wise Performance Analysis: 
 Investigate the performance of different countries in various sports and Olympic Games to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement.
#### 4. Sport-wise Performance Analysis:
Analyze the performance of different sports in terms of participation, medal counts, and performance trends over the years.
#### 5. Trend Identification: 
Identify any patterns, trends, or correlations between athlete performance, medal distribution, and sports participation over the years.



### Steps followed 

- Step 1: Load data into Tableau public, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2: Open the Tableau query editor. Under the Data Preview section, in the view tab, check the "column distribution," "column quality," and "column profile" options.
- Step 3: Also since by default, the profile will be opened only for 1000 rows you need to select "column profiling based on the entire dataset".
- Step 4: It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "Arrival Delay".
- Step 5: For calculating average delay time, null values were not taken into account as only less than 1% values are null in this column(i.e column named "Arrival Delay") 
- Step 6: In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 7: Since the data contains various ratings, thus to represent ratings, a new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in the report view. 
- Step 8: Visual filters (Slicers) were added for four fields named "Class", "Customer Type", "Gate Location" & "Type of travel".
- Step 9: Two card visuals were added to the canvas, one representing average departure delay in minutes & other representing average arrival delay in minutes.
           Using a visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration in the average calculation.
